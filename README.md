## Description

This project creates a simple logo based on user input through the command line. Throughout the project I had to incorporate testing and learned the Test Driven Development approach. I also worked with classes and module exports. Follow this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xt4r3KG-mpjejH-JdozN7ZEqlPymksYp/view) to view a walkthrough video.
